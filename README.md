You will need Borland C++ Builder 5 to compile

For MobileMAC I used XCode to compile. Since this version uses Carbon, I think it is hard to compile with a newer version.
The mobile Mac version was developped with Mac OS X 10.1

For JavaME and Siemens Phones I used Borland JBuilder with Java ME and the Siemens Phone SDK.
The JavaME version was used with a Nokia and a Sony Ericson. The Siemens Phone was used with an S65 and a C65.

For Android I used Eclipse with Android SDK, may be I will switch to Android Developper Studio or newer in future. Currently I do not use the mobile version, thus I need not to compile.
The Android Version was used with an HTC Desire.


A setup can be downloaded from my website
